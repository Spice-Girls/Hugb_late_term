# Hugb_late_term
# Purpose
Learn to set up technical infrastructure to support agile development. The main
challenge is to glue together the bits and pieces through the latter half of this
class, into a coherent infrastructure.
# Description
Each team should implement the game TicTacToe. The main focus is on the
infrastructure and best coding practices described below but not on
implemented features.


The project and infrastructure should tackle the following:

  1. The code base is stored in source control system on GitHub from early
start of the project (the teacher should be able to track the history of the
project from the creation of the very first file).
  2. The system is setup with automatic build that must run all unit tests.
  3. The output is a deployable or executable artifact, such as a jar/war or
equivalent.
  4. The build script has deploy/install target that deploys the executable
outside of the working directory or on external server.
  5. The business logic should be coded using Test Driven Development.
  6. The code should be loosely coupled and follow good object oriented
design practices.
  7. It is possible to get extra points for the following
    1. More build targets (0,5 point per item, never more than 1 for this part)
      Code coverages
      Code inspection
      Integrate database
    2. Run focused integration or End-to-end tests (e.g. Selenium). It is
    Late-term Assignment
    Purpose
    Description
    necessary to run this on external staging server (e.g. Heroku). To run
    integration test the application needs to connect to external system
    e.g. database. To run end-to-end test the system needs to have GUI
    (e.g. webUI). (1 point)
    3. Use Automated Continuous Integration Server (e.g. Travis). (1 point)
    4. Continuous Delivery. For each code change the CI server runs these
    steps:
    Run build script (all targets)
    Run unit and integration tests (if you have integration tests)
    Deploy on staging and run End-to-end tests.
    Deploy to production server.
    Only continue next step if previuous step is success
    Generate feedback to developer
    5. Something else ... Surprise me !!!
# Grade
Solving parts 1-6 perfectly will together give a grade of 6, it's ok to have all
    targets in build script manual. In order to get a 10, you'll need to solve at least
4 extra points.
# Return form
1. URL of root of the project in the source control system
2. Development manual, that is, what is needed and how to get the project
to build on a fresh machine
Source control client and access to source control
Build environment
Other necessary dependencies
3. Administration manual, how to set it up and get it to run, also on a fresh
machine.
How to install and run the program on clients machine (in case of
simple desktop program)
How to deploy, run and maintain in case of client/server or web
application.
Grade
Return form
4. Design report
Document describing initial design

# Demonstration
The team will have a 15 minutes demonstration of the technical infrastructure
and the simple functionality developed. The demonstrations will be held in the
last week, the detailed schedule will be published later. The distributed groups
will demonstrate using shared desktop. The demonstration is part of the grade
for this assignment. If you ar not able to show some part of the build
process (if it is broken) in the demonstration it will not count in the
grade. ​
